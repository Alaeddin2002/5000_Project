136,136," 'Israel pulled back tanks from friction points and Palestinian police restrained rock throwers Thursday, in first tentative steps to carry out a truce agreement reached by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres in an overnight meeting. The cease-fire was to take hold Thursday afternoon with announcements by Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak. However, in the hours leading up to the deadline, a 17-year-old Palestinian was killed in a rock-throwing clash with Israeli troops in the West Bank village of Hizme, near Jerusalem, and Palestinian gunmen fired on Israeli positions in the West Bank town of Hebron, drawing return fire. Clashes also erupted in the Gaza Strip. But in at least two locations, near the Jewish settlements of Kfar Darom and Netzarim in Gaza, Palestinian police pushed back rock throwers for the first time in several weeks. Near Netzarim, police bundled several dozen stone throwers in trucks and drove them away. Previous cease-fire agreements, including one brokered by President Clinton last month, did not hold, with each side accusing the other of violating commitments. Peres and Arafat met at the Palestinian leader\'s Gaza City office for two hours late Wednesday in the first high-level meeting since the conflict erupted Sept. 28. At least 162 people have been killed in the fighting, most of them Palestinians. ""We hope we shall have two or three days without funerals,"" Peres told Associated Press Television News. ""We shall return to normalize the situation in the territories and return to peace talks."" Palestinian peace negotiator Nabil Shaath said that according to the understandings reached, Israel will gradually lift its closure of Palestinian areas, permit Palestinian workers to return to jobs in Israel and open Gaza International Airport, as well as border crossings with Egypt and Jordan. Such restrictions have cost the Palestinian economy about $4 million a day, the U.N. relief agency for Palestinian refugees said Wednesday. Arafat convened his Cabinet ministers around noon. In an apparent call for calm, the Palestinian Information Ministry said in a statement that ""the Palestinian leadership asks our Palestinian people and all our national forces to forge a united stand and express ourselves peacefully in all circumstances in our national struggle."" But the leader of the Islamic militant group Hamas, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said the Palestinian uprising against Israel would continue. Yassin said the protests were an expression of popular anger and could not be reined in by an order from Arafat. Barak and Arafat spoke by phone before the 2 p.m. deadline to coordinate the wording of their announcements, which were to be broadcast live by Israeli and Palestinian media, respectively, Barak\'s office said. Barak also expressed sorrow for the killing of the Palestinian teen-ager Thursday. Israeli security officials, meanwhile, announced that a Palestinian militant has been caught in the Israeli town of Upper Nazareth. The officials said the man had plotted to carry out a suicide attack in northern Israel. On Thursday morning, Israel pulled back tanks from several friction points in the Gaza Strip, including the Karni crossing, where eight Palestinians were killed in two days of fierce gun battles. One of the Karni protesters died Thursday of injuries sustained earlier. Israeli soldiers withdrew from a Palestinian police post at Karni which they had seized earlier this week. Israel also lifted its siege of several West Bank towns, including Nablus, Bethlehem and Hebron. Within a few hours, Palestinians were to be able to move freely in the West Bank, said Brig. Gen. Ron Kitrey, the Israeli army spokesman. Israeli and Palestinian troop commanders and lower-level officers held a series of talks in the West Bank and Gaza to work out the details of the truce. As a result of the agreement, Israel at the last minute froze attacks on Palestinian targets that were to come as retaliation for the killing of three Israeli soldiers in gun battles with Palestinians on Wednesday. The three soldiers were the first to die in combat since Oct. 1. Seven Palestinians were also killed, as armed clashes intensified in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and the conflict appeared to be spiraling out of control. Denouncing what he called ""grave escalation initiated by the Palestinian Authority,"" Barak convened a special session of his Cabinet late Wednesday and ""decided on a number of appropriate steps,"" a statement said. But the Peres-Arafat meeting led to the decision to hold the fire. Each side has blamed the other for the violence. Israel says its forces have responded with restraint to Palestinian attacks. The Palestinians charge that Israel has used excessive force in putting down demonstrations. A pitched battle was fought Wednesday in the village of Al Khader, near Bethlehem, where two Israeli soldiers and three Palestinians were killed Wednesday. Four Israeli soldiers were wounded. Heavy Palestinian gunfire prevented Israeli forces from reaching the soldiers who were hit, so the Israelis sent attack helicopters to rake the village with machine guns while tanks provided covering fire for an armored vehicle to retrieve the soldiers. Israeli attack helicopters and tanks fired at Palestinian intelligence headquarters in Jericho overnight, in retaliation for Palestinian gunfire at an Israeli army outpost where a reserve army officer was killed, the military said.', 'web_url'"

Haig Jr. said today that he had obtained President Hosni Mubarak's agreement for an intensified effort in coming months to achieve a breakthrough in the negotiations with Israel on Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.   In a 90-minute meeting at Mr. Mubarak's office in Oruba Palace, Mr. Haig was reported to have said that the United States believed Egypt and Israel had spent enough time over the last 20 months inconclusively discussing the issues and that he was ready to give his attention to helping them accelerate their efforts for an agreement.   Kamal Hassan Ali, Egypt's Foreign Minister, told reporters later, ''Our view is that we welcome the participation of Secretary Haig in the process because we feel that it will push forward the negotiations for the autonomy.'' Haig to Meet With Begin   Mr. Haig flies to Israel on Thursday to confer with Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Foreign Minister Yitzhak Shamir on their reaction to his plans for pushing the negotiations forward. Assuming that the Israelis agree, Mr. Haig must then decide whether to devote a considerable part of his time in the near future to Middle East negotiations or whether he will appoint a special negotiator to do most of the work, with Mr. Haig giving instructions from Washington."", 'web_url'"
